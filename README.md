# Software Engineering Daily iOS App

Native iOS app for [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/).

## Setup

We are using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage dependencies.

Clone the repo and then run:

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod install
```

CocoaPods requires that you open the *SEDaily-IOS.xcworkspace*.

```
$ open SEDaily-IOS.xcworkspace
```
